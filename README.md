## Problem Statement :-<br>
To detect the occupancy of beds in nearby hospitals.<br>
 
As we all know the impact of Covid-19 was caused globally and it became difficult to  detect the occupancy of beds in hospital.<br> 
So, we developed such a website that shows the availability of beds in hospitals in an easy to understand way.<br>
The name of our website is “SAWASTHA” ,derived from Sanskrit word “SWASTHA” which means health and well-being, we’re aiming for the well-being of the human nation.<br>
The major role of “SAWASTHA” is to let the user know the occupancy of beds in hospitals from the comfort of their homes.

## Introduction

- Solution: To design a website detecting the occupancy of beds in hospitals. 
- Website consists of multiple activities such as Registration and login, Dashboard, login information, etc. for users and hospitals.
- Index page of the website consists of multiple functionalities such as the list of all nearby hospitals with red light and green light in front of each Hospital name to indicate the availability of beds in the hospital.
- Website will show Hospital details, medicine Availability, Equipment Availability, and Blood-Related information.  
- Hospitals need to update their profile regularly, need internet connectivity in each hospital, and one or two staff members to handle their profile.
- We will use a cloud database for storing and retrieving user and hospital-related data.
- The website will send messages to nearby people with the same blood group in case of urgent blood requirements and also at the time of blood donation camp or any health-related activities.
