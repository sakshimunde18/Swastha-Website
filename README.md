# Swastha
 The problem statement of our website was To detect the occupancy of beds in nearby hospitals.<br>
As we all know the impact of Covid-19 was caused globally and it became difficult to  detect the occupancy of beds in hospital.<br> 
So, we developed such a website that shows the availability of beds in hospitals in an easy to understand way.<br>
The name of our website is “SAWASTHA” ,derived from Sanskrit word “SWASTHA” which means health and well-being, we’re aiming for the well-being of the human nation.<br>
The major role of “SAWASTHA” is to let the user know the occupancy of beds in hospitals from the comfort of their homes.
